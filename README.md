You might encounter SmartScreen flagging this program as an unknown publisher warning, 
cuz I ain't got a certificate and this program was just made as new as a new born baby.
The program is built from Visual Studio, so if you have some OCD of some sorts, paste the source code into a new console app,
change debug mode to release and build solutions, then it will show the path of the program you've built in the output section.
GCC and MinGW should work, but I know nothing about them and alternatives.

You can also use the source code to make some modifications yourself, make a GUI or whatever.

Commands (work during any promopts, doesn't need to be at first question):
Type either of those (or shortcut key, e.g. just enter q to quit, f to flush) to quit

quit(q)

leave(l)

exit(e)

Type flush(f) or clear(c) to flush screen
